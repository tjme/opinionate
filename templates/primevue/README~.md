# PrimeVue sample

A sample app to demonstrate the use of the following combination of tech. (as a basis for developing templates for opinionate):

- PostgreSQL
- PostGraphile
- Vue v3
- TypeScript
- VeeValidate
- PrimeVue
- Villus
- Vite

This version supports fully functional datatables (for each entity), with clickable references/counts/links to related datatables/entities including pagination, sorting and column sizing (with both left and right-aligned columns).

In addition, full CRUD operations are supported (mostly via a pop-up form dialog).

Communications with the GraphQL server are supported by Villus (rather than the more popular Apollo), primarily because I was able to make it function correctly with the Vue v3/Composition API.

Work in progress:

- Where link counts for (one to many) related entities are generated, the first field is *assumed* to be the primary key (and recorded as field.link.fieldsFrom).
- A basic homepage/switchboard is created as a *starting point*, but it may need refinement (e.g. it might not perform well with a large database).
- You may want to restructure the menubar (in src/App.vue) by reordering and/or splitting into submenus.
