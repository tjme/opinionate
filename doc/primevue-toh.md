# Example [Vue](https://vuejs.org)/[PrimeVue](https://github.com/primefaces/primevue) front-end, using [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) and [Villus](https://github.com/logaretm/villus)

- Create database, following [toh example database](toh-example.md)
- install Vite: `pnpm -g add vite`
- make/change to your project directory: `mkdir vue-toh && cd vue-toh`
- initialize: `pnpm create vite . --template vue-ts`
- you are advised to initialize version control to help track source code changes (e.g. `git init`)
- create a data sources directory: `mkdir models`
- rename or remove the default package.json
- copy or merge the template's [package~.json](https://github.com/tjme/opinionate/blob/master/templates/primevue/package~.json) as your new ./package.json (or selectively copy/paste, especially the following scripts, and codegen configuration, e.g. adjusting the database name 'toh' in the script for 'backend')
- install dependencies: `pnpm i`
- run the GraphQL server (in the background), if not already running: `pnpm backend &`
- generate JSON schema files: `pnpm gen-json` (alternatively, if not using PostGraphile, use apollo `pnpm gen-json-a` or get-graphql-schema `pnpm gen-json-g`)
- optionally generate GraphQL schema files: `pnpm gen-gql` (alternatively, ditto the above)
- create the TypeScript type definitions for the schema: `pnpm gen-ts`
- optionally you can click on the link to GraphiQL generated by the above, and explore the server by entering queries such as: `{allFilms {nodes {description releaseYear languageId length rating nodeId}}}`
- create a configuration/overlay (for later enhancement and customization): `pnpm gen-overlay`
- to automatically (re)generate fully functional components/pages for each GraphQL node/entity, as well as common items: `pnpm gen`
- run the development server, to deliver your new website: `pnpm dev`
- or build: `pnpm build` then run a production version: `pnpm preview`
- See [README~.md](templates/primevue/README~.md) for further details
- Note: there are also sample copies of the schema files in [models](https://github.com/tjme/opinionate/blob/master/models)
